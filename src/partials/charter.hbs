<h2 class="h1">Values</h2>
<p>While homelessness remains, this charter provides guiding principles concerning the rights of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. We believe that everyone who is homeless should have a right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A safe, secure home</strong> along with an appropriate level of support to create a good quality of life</li>
  <li><strong>Safety</strong> from violence, abuse, theft and discrimination, and the full protection of the law</li>
  <li><strong>Respect</strong> and a good standard of service everywhere</li>
  <li><strong>Equality of access</strong> to information and services</li>
  <li><strong>Equality of opportunity</strong> to employment, training, volunteering, leisure and creative activities</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that those who work with homeless people have a collective responsibility to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Good communication, coordination and a consistent approach</strong> is delivered across all services</li>
  <li><strong>People with experience of homelessness have a voice and involvement</strong> in determining the solutions to their own issues, to homelessness, and in wider society</li>
</ul>
