      <p>There are lots of lovely people across Manchester who are working hard, or willing, to help support people who are homeless.  Think of the Charter as your membership to join one big happy family: the Charter is a way to bring us all together, giving us one shared vision and a platform to link up our resources and skills.  This means we can focus our efforts efficiently and effectively to tackle key challenges and ultimately move towards banishing homelessness.</p>

      <p>The Charter will launch on 9th May at Friend’s Meeting House.</p>
      <p>Presented by the Bishop of Manchester and attended by Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, this will be a historic event which celebrates the commitment of our city’s people, organisations and businesses to tackling homelessness. A symbolic handing over from the Manchester Homelessness Partnership to homeless people will be part of the launch and there’ll be opportunities to pledge your support and join an action group too.</p>
