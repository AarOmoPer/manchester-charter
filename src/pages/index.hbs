      <h2 class="h2">[Why a Charter?]</h2>
      <p>[A charter may seem like an archaic term, but it's a cohesive way of making sure everyone sticks to some basic principles. There are many fantastic organisations across Manchester, and this Charter hopes to unite them under a common strategy so that time and resources can be used most effectively to create change.]</p>
