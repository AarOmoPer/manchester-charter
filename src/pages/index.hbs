        <h2 class="h2">Why a Charter?</h2>
        <p>There are lots of dedicated people across Manchester who are working hard to support people who are homeless, and many more who would like to do something to help. The Charter is a way to bring us all together with a shared vision, so that we can focus our efforts effectively to tackle key challenges, and ultimately to end homelessness.</p>

        <p>The Charter will launch on 9th May at Friend’s Meeting House.</p>
        <p>Presented by the Bishop of Manchester and attended by Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, this will be a historic event which celebrates the commitment of our city’s people, organisations and businesses to tackling homelessness. There will be a symbolic handing over from the Manchester Homelessness Partnership to the city, and opportunities to pledge your support and join an action group too.</p>
