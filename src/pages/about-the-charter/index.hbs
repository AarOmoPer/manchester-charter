      <p>In response to the growing challenge of homelessness in our city, significant consultation took place with homeless people, with a leader’s event in October 2015. Mustard Tree volunteered to lead the development of a Charter, drawing on best practice nationally and internationally.</p>

      <p>Organisations and individuals will be asked to support the charter by pledging action that they will take to move towards this vision.</p>
      <p>Action groups will be set up to get experts from a range of backgrounds to work together to address areas which have been identified as needing improvement. These action groups include mental health provision, employability, substandard accommodation, evening provision, presenting as homeless at the town hall, alternatives to street giving, and more.</p>
